# Leave/Enter Discord Bot
Bot for Discord that will notify the server when someone leaves/joins a voice channel. It finds a text channel to post this message in by finding the first text channel within that voice channel's category that contains "text" or "voice." Prevents spamming by editing the same message for when the same person enters/leaves multiple times within the same time frame.
